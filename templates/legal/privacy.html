<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025-08-19</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how the ComeBack Admin panel (the “Service”) collects, uses, discloses, retains, and protects information. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Policy.</p>

<h2>2. Scope and roles</h2>
<p>The Service is an internal, Django-based administrative tool used by authorized personnel to manage AR content (videos with GPS coordinates), synchronize data with Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage, review payments, and generate one-time passwords (OTP) for cash payments. User roles include “Administrator” and “Cashier.” Your organization acts as the data controller for information processed through the Service, and may engage third-party processors (e.g., Firebase by Google) to support functionality.</p>

<h2>3. Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (where applicable under local law).</li>
  <li>“Processing” means any operation performed on information, such as collection, storage, use, disclosure, or deletion.</li>
  <li>“Controller/Processor” have the meanings assigned under applicable data protection law (e.g., GDPR).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Categories of information</h2>
<p>Depending on your role and use, we may process the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account data:</strong> username (login), role (Administrator/Cashier), internal identifiers. Passwords are stored as cryptographic hashes and are never stored in plain text.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational data:</strong> video metadata (title, description, GPS coordinates), subscription settings (price, duration, currency), OTP codes (value, quantity, status, timestamps, created by), payment records (order ID, amount, currency, status, timestamps, description where provided, subscription duration, OTP/cash flag).</li>
  <li><strong>Content and media:</strong> uploaded video files and associated descriptions; public storage URLs where applicable.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, device/browser information, timestamps, session identifiers, error events, audit trails, application and server logs.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration data:</strong> identifiers and metadata required to synchronize with Firebase services.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies and sessions:</strong> identifiers strictly necessary for authentication and session continuity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Sources of information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Information you provide (e.g., uploading videos, creating OTP codes).</li>
  <li>Information generated by the Service (e.g., audit logs, IDs, timestamps).</li>
  <li>Information synchronized with third-party providers to enable functionality (e.g., Firebase).</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Purposes of processing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide, operate, and secure the Service, including role-based access control.</li>
  <li>Audit, log, and monitor actions for security and compliance.</li>
  <li>Synchronize content and operational data with Firebase (Realtime Database and Storage).</li>
  <li>Generate and track OTP codes for cash payments and present payment statistics.</li>
  <li>Improve performance, reliability, and usability, and troubleshoot issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Legal bases</h2>
<p>Where required by law, processing is carried out based on: (a) performance of a contract or assigned duties; (b) legitimate interests in operating and securing the Service; (c) compliance with legal obligations (e.g., record-keeping); and, where applicable, (d) consent.</p>

<h2>8. Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Account data: retained for the life of the account and up to 12 months after deactivation, unless internal policy requires otherwise.</li>
  <li>Logs and technical data: retained for at least 6 months, then archived or deleted per internal policy.</li>
  <li>Content and payment records: retained per accounting, audit, operational, and legal requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Disclosures and recipients</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal:</strong> authorized personnel (Administrators, Cashiers) on a need-to-know basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Firebase (Google) for hosting, realtime database, and storage; processing is subject to their terms and applicable law.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> where required by law, regulation, court order, or to protect rights, safety, or the integrity of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. International transfers</h2>
<p>Use of Firebase may involve international transfers. Providers may rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses). By using the Service, you acknowledge such transfers may occur to deliver core functionality.</p>

<h2>11. Security measures</h2>
<p>We employ organizational and technical measures, including authentication, role-based access controls, principle of least privilege, monitoring, and—where applicable—encrypted transport. No method is entirely secure; residual risk remains.</p>

<h2>12. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
<p>We use session cookies and similar identifiers strictly necessary for authentication and session continuity. Blocking these may impair functionality.</p>

<h2>13. Your rights</h2>
<p>Subject to applicable law, you may request: (a) access; (b) rectification; (c) erasure or restriction; (d) portability (where applicable); and (e) objection to certain processing. Submit requests via your organization’s internal channels to the Service administrator. We may verify identity and may retain limited information as required by law or legitimate interests (e.g., security logs).</p>

<h2>14. Children’s data</h2>
<p>The Service is intended for authorized personnel and is not directed to children under 18.</p>

<h2>15. Automated decision-making and profiling</h2>
<p>The Service does not engage in automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects.</p>

<h2>16. Data accuracy</h2>
<p>Users are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information. We may request updates to maintain accuracy.</p>

<h2>17. Third-party services and links</h2>
<p>Third-party providers (e.g., Firebase by Google) process data under their own terms and privacy notices. This Policy covers processing performed by the Service only.</p>

<h2>18. Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy from time to time. The current version is available on this page. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>19. Contact</h2>
<p>For privacy questions or data subject requests, contact your organization’s Service administrator via internal channels.</p>

<h2>20. Data processing principles</h2>
<p>We adhere to recognized principles where applicable: lawfulness, fairness, transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality; and accountability.</p>

<h2>21. Lawful basis mapping</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication, access control, and security logging — legitimate interests; legal obligations.</li>
  <li>Content synchronization with Firebase — performance of duties; legitimate interests.</li>
  <li>Payment overview and OTP management — performance of duties; legal obligations (record‑keeping), where applicable.</li>
  <li>Analytics for stability and troubleshooting — legitimate interests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>22. Records of processing and DPIA</h2>
<p>Where required, your organization maintains records of processing activities and performs data protection impact assessments (DPIA) for high‑risk processing, including synchronization with third‑party services.</p>

<h2>23. Sub‑processors</h2>
<p>The Service relies on third‑party providers for hosting and synchronization (e.g., Firebase by Google). Your organization evaluates provider terms, security, and transfer mechanisms before use. Additional sub‑processors, if any, should be documented internally.</p>

<h2>24. Security program overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Access management: role‑based access control, least privilege, periodic reviews.</li>
  <li>Authentication: secure credential storage, session management.</li>
  <li>Logging and monitoring: audit trails for key actions, error/event logging.</li>
  <li>Data handling: controlled environments for content and metadata; careful handling of public URLs.</li>
  <li>Continuity: backups and recovery procedures as defined by organizational policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>25. Incident response and breach notification</h2>
<p>Suspected incidents are investigated promptly. Where a personal‑data breach is likely to result in risk to individuals, notifications are made in accordance with applicable law and internal policy (including to supervisory authorities and affected individuals, where required).</p>

<h2>26. Data retention schedule (illustrative)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Access logs and technical events: ≥ 6 months (then archive or delete).</li>
  <li>Operational records (payments, OTP): per accounting/audit policy (e.g., 3–5 years) unless law requires longer.</li>
  <li>Accounts: life of account + up to 12 months post‑deactivation.</li>
  <li>Backups: rotated per internal backup policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>27. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Strictly necessary: session/authentication cookies required for core functionality.</li>
  <li>Optional categories (if enabled by your organization): performance or functional cookies; these will be disclosed and, where required, consented to before use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>28. Data subject request handling</h2>
<p>Requests (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection) should be submitted via internal channels. Identification may be required. Responses will be provided within timelines required by law, subject to permissible extensions and exemptions.</p>

<h2>29. Complaints and supervisory authority</h2>
<p>If you believe processing infringes applicable law, you may lodge a complaint with your organization and/or the competent data protection authority in your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>30. International transfers</h2>
<p>Where data is transferred internationally (e.g., to Firebase infrastructure), appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) and provider measures are relied upon, where required. Your use of the Service acknowledges the necessity of such transfers for its operation.</p>

<h2>31. Interpretation and conflicts</h2>
<p>In case of conflict between this Policy and a localized/internal policy of your organization, the stricter or more specific rule shall prevail to the extent permitted by law.</p>
